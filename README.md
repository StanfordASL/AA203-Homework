## Setup tips

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage python dependencies (for instance, using `conda` or `pyenv`). You'll need Python >=3.7 (newer versions preferred)

Dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these, `pip install -r requirements.txt` with your environment activated.
